# JB Battery Arabic

JBBATTERY differs from all other lithium-ion battery companies due to the reliability and performance of our cells. We specialize in selling high quality lithium batteries for golf cart, forklift, boats, recreational vehicles, solar panel banks, specialized electric vehicles, and more. So far we have distributed more than 15,000 batteries worldwide.

Not only does JBBATTERY have one of the largest LiFEPO4 battery stocks in the world, we also have the ability to build custom batteries for almost any application. One example is our dedicated 24V, 36V and 48V batteries that are specially designed for trolling motors. Boat passengers have never been able to travel further on a trolling motor battery.

This is what JBBATTERY specializes in, finding practical solutions to challenging energy situations. The ultimate goal of the lithium battery is to meet the demand for reliable and efficient energy of future generations.
